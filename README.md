# That's right. I'm _**Kira**_ ✍️

_Kira_ is an LLM I'm trying to implement using Equinox (which is built on top of Jax). It's a work in progress, but I'm hoping to get it to a point where I can use it to train a decent model using Equinox's new MHA implementation.

## Current Status

Currently, I'm testing this LLM on the TinyShakespeare dataset. So far, I get to a loss of `~0.36`.
